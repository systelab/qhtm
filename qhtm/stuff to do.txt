Work
----
* Add ability to replace a named section of HTML.
* Add Select/copy (make it an option).
* Add horizontal scroll messages as per vertical scroll messages.
* BUG: Form fields are not resized when altering the zoom level. They are okay when the page is refreshed.

* Tables: Recode to support column and row spanning and to also behave properly when floating.
		Note to self; COLSPAN is now done.
* Add support for table CAPTION.
* Add support for entities such as Euro
* Table borders should use the 3D colours in the system
* Add BASE
* Support ISMAP
* Notify when the mouse passes over a link (pass ID, title and URL)
* Add support for icons to the image library.
* Add support for image maps
	<img src="navbar.gif" border=0 usemap="#map1">
	<map name="map1">
	 <area href=guide.html alt="Access Guide" shape=rect coords="0,0,118,28">
	 <area href=search.html alt="Search" shape=rect coords="184,0,276,28">
	 <area href=shortcut.html alt="Go" shape=rect coords="118,0,184,28">
	 <area href=top10.html alt="Top Ten" shape=rect coords="276,0,373,28">
	</map>
* Add support for FRAMES...FRAMESET, FRAME etc. http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/frames.html
	When adding frames would need to cascade options, fonts, etc.
* Add "target" to links - needed for frames.
* FORM tabindex, accesskey
* Add hyphenation rules so hyphenated words break correctly.
* Add <blink speed=n>text</blink> 'n' is ms


CSS Stuff to support and my notes
---------------------------------
Nothing yet, still reading...


HTML that causes problems
-------------------------

* This just doesn't look right, look at the difference between IE and QHTM.
Try changing align=left and we get similar stupid differences between QHTM and IE.
**Update - right works okay but left isn't working as the margins are pushing the second para out a bit.
----BEGIN
<p>a<table bgcolor=yellow align=right> <tr><td>1</td></tr></table>
<p>b<table bgcolor=yellow align=right> <tr><td>2</td></tr></table>
<p>c<table bgcolor=yellow align=right> <tr><td>3</td></tr></table>
----END

* This doesn't move the images onto the correct line
----BEGIN
<p><img src="RES:CIRCLE.BMP" align=right><br>
<img src="RES:CIRCLE.BMP" align=right><br>
<img src="RES:CIRCLE.BMP" align=right><br>
<img src="RES:CIRCLE.BMP" align=right><br>
<img src="RES:CIRCLE.BMP" align=right><br>
----END

* BUG: The second DT appears as part of the first list
Works fine if the LI has either OL or UL.
----BEGIN
<DL>
  <DT>Dweeb
  <DD>Young excitable person who may mature into a <EM>Nerd</EM> or <EM>Geek</EM>
  <li>This is the cause
</DL>
<DT>I'm in the wrong list
----END

Table should be centered. CENTER also fails.
-----BEGIN
<p align=center>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>hello</td></tr>
</table>
-----END

There is an extra gap between item3 and item4:
-----BEGIN
top<br>
<ul>
	<li>item1</li>
	<li>item2
		<ul>
			<li>item3</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>item4</li>
</ul>
bottom
-----END

D:\HTML Test files\big report\Report.htm - just looks bad, horizontal scrollbar is set but doesn't scroll. Very bad.
D:\HTML Test files\bad form #3 - speaks for itself.


Internal tidying up
-------------------
CScrollContainer::SetUsingScroll is not used. All related code should be removed (carefully).
DrawTiledBitmap in CHTMLSection needs optimising as it uses *way* to much resource.
