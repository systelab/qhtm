This library is a collection of GUI, drawing or window management functions and classes.

Pretty much anything that has to do with GUI work belongs in this library.

Anything that uses this library inherits a certain amount of independence from the
Windows API. Using something similar I have ported large amounts of code to new
platforms. Nothing here is ported but it does provide a nice abstraction layer.
